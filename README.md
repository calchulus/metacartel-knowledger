# knowledger
A project to list *ALL* projects in the blockchain space. 


# TODOs:
[ ] Remove Firebase dependency as a backend to make it an on-chain TCR

[ ] Add credentialing/paywall to prevent spam from being added on /submit.html

[ ] Change Project Category tags

[ ]Add more sorting features other than Alphabetical

[ ] Clean up unnecessary code

[ ] Auto-generate subpages for every card created, to be populated later with further information on each project ( 'pages' are really just identities managed by their owned but curated by the registry. - Peter)
